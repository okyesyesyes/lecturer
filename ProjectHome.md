Lecturer is an eBook reader for portable devices that not only displays the text in an easy-to-read font with adjustable margins and spacing, but is also able to read it out loud!

The speech output code uses the Loquendo TTS system installed on recent TomTom Go mobile GPS navigation units. Developed for the TomTom Go 730, it should also work on 930 models. While the text-to-speech component is closely tied to that platform, the plain text viewer is easily ported to any system with a Linux framebuffer device or SDL.
